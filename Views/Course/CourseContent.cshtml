            <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4">Introduction</h4>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century. From its inception to its present capabilities and future potential, AI has continuously evolved, reshaping industries, enhancing human lives, and revolutionizing the way we interact with machines. This article explores AI from its beginnings to its expected future impact, covering its history, key developments, current applications, ethical concerns, and what lies ahead.</p>

            <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4">The Origins of AI</h4>
            <p>The concept of AI can be traced back to ancient mythology, where artificial beings were imagined to have human-like intelligence. However, the formal birth of AI as a field of study took place in the mid-20th century. In 1956, John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon organized the Dartmouth Conference, which marked the official beginning of AI research. The goal was to create machines capable of mimicking human intelligence.</p>
            <p>During the 1950s and 1960s, researchers developed early AI programs that could solve algebra problems, play chess, and even mimic human speech. However, due to limited computational power and data availability, progress was slow. The 1970s and 1980s saw AI face its first "AI Winter," a period of reduced funding and interest due to unmet expectations.</p>

            <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4">Breakthroughs in AI</h4>
            <p>AI made significant strides in the late 20th and early 21st centuries due to advancements in computing power, data availability, and algorithmic improvements. Some key milestones include:</p>
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-3">
                <li class="list-group-item border-0 ps-0"><strong>Expert Systems (1970s-1980s):</strong> These were programs designed to simulate the decision-making abilities of human experts. They were widely used in medical diagnosis and industrial automation.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item border-0 ps-0"><strong>Machine Learning (1990s-2000s):</strong> With improved algorithms and more powerful computers, AI moved from rule-based systems to learning-based models. Support vector machines, decision trees, and neural networks became popular.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item border-0 ps-0"><strong>Deep Learning (2010s-Present):</strong> Inspired by the human brain, deep learning utilizes artificial neural networks to process massive amounts of data. This approach led to breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4">AI in Today's World</h4>
